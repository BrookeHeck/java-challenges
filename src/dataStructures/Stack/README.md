# Stack
A stack is a list that adds and removes nodes in a last in first out order.
The nodes still hold a value and next reference,
but the nodes are always added and removed from the top of the stack.
The stack is instantiated with a null top property.
Then nodes are popped off of the top or pushed onto the top.
