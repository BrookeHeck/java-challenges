# Java Challenges
This repository contains implementations of data structures and coding challenges.

## Data Structures
[Data Structures](https://github.com/BrookeHeck/java-challenges/tree/main/src/dataStructures)

The data structures implemented are linked list, stack, queue, hashmap, and graph. 
The implementations include common methods found for each data structure along with tests.
See the readmes for each data structure for more information and detailed instructions on how to use the api.


## Code Challenges
[Code Challenges]()

The code challenges in this repository are algorithms using the data structures implemented.
The challenges come from online sites, such as HackerRank, and also from the Code Fellows software development class.
I took the JavaScript course, but I have redone many of the challenges to practice my skills in Java.
